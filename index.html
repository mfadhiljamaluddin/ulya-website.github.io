      <h4><span class="w3-tag w3-light-black">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="w3-text-black">Currently, Periplus.com delivers only to all addresses within Indonesia.  We can also accept overseas orders, but we won’t accept for now requests for overseas delivery (outside of Indonesia) except their intended shipping addresses are within Indonesia.</p><br>
    
      <h4><span class="w3-tag w3-light-black">Delivery Charges & Delivery Times</span></h4>
      <p class="w3-text-black">Some items on our website are already available in Indonesia and other need to be imported from overseas. Delivery charges and times will vary depending on the delivery option you selected on the Checkout page.  If you order more than one item, you have the following options: </p><br>
            <p class="w3-text-black"><b>- Send all of my items in one shipment : </b> Choosing this option will be cheaper and save you some money on shipping.  Since we are consolidating your items into one shipment, Delivery Times depend on the availability of the all items you ordered, and you might have to wait for all of your order to arrive. </p><br>
            <p class="w3-text-black"><b>- I want my item faster :</b>  Please ship items as they become available – Choosing this option will get your items shipped as soon as they available, especially those items which already in stock locally.  Shipping costs will be calculated separately for each delivery, but you will get some of your items earlier and faster compare with another option. </p><br>
            <p class="w3-text-black"><b>- Free Shipping: </b> Aside from the area within Jabodetabek, we also offer a FREE SHIPPING for those places located within the Greater Java Areas for a minimum total purchase: Rp 100,000, if shipping address located within the JABODETABEK, Rp 300,000, for other places beyond JABODETABEK but within the greater Java areas. </p><br>
        
      <h4><span class="w3-tag w3-light-black">Order Tracking</span></h4>
      <p class="w3-text-black">You can track the status of your order by checking through your  <b> Order History </b> page using the tracking reference stated in our confirmation email. If the status of your order is already processed, Tracking Reference will be provided which you can use to track your shipment through the delivery provider website.</p><br>
    
      <h4><span class="w3-tag w3-light-black">Restrictions</span></h4>

      <h4><span class="w3-tag w3-light-black"> Items Availability </span></h4>
      <p class="w3-text-black">The <b>In Stock</b> status shown on the product detail page tells you that we have a sufficient amount locally ready to serve our online and offline outlets until it reached the threshold quantity and it will become <b>Out of Stock</b>.Placing an item in your shopping cart doesn’t necessarily hold the item for you, it will only reserve for you until you click the <b>Place Your Order</b> button, finish the checkout process and you get the email confirmation that we’ve already received your order. <b>Best selling items</b> can sell out quickly, and it is possible that the availability status in product details would change suddenly while placing your order or before finishing your checkout process. If the item’s status became out of stock after you place your order, we’ll immediately send you a notification email.</p>

      <h4><span class="w3-tag w3-light-black">Delivery Service Delays</span></h4>
